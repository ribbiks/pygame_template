# pygame_template
A blank pygame project with some handy systems in place. Basically a DIY game engine.
* Fixed timestep + async gameloop (for [pygbag](https://github.com/pygame-web/pygbag) compatibility)
* Integer-scaled display (no crunchy pixel art in fullscreen modes)
* Mouse / keyboard / joystick inputs
* Gamestates organized in a semi-reasonable manner
* _No documentation!_
